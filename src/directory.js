    p: "First named in 1821, more than a hundred valid species have since been described.<br><br> They have paddle-like flippers and unique adaptations for swimming, which is reminiscent of modern-day turtles! Studies suggest that Turtles are actually their closest living relative. <br><br> The Plesiosaurus was an early plesiosaur, shortly into their evoloutionary history, this dinosaur split into two lineages. The pilosaurs with their short necks and elongated heads, and the plesiosauroids with their smaller heads and flexible snake-like necks.<br><br> It is possible that some plesiosaurs' long necks caused back problems! In the 1970's paleontologists found a fossil of a plesiosaur spine with disease. Instead of the more common scars, breaks and teethmarks, these bones had lesions from a spinal condition known as Schmorl’s nodes, with 24 out of 27 vertebrae affected. While common for humans, this was the first discovered in anything non-human!<br><br>",

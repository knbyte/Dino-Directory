# About the Dino-Directory ðŸ¦•

The Dino Database is a passion project I started to hone my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. As a lifelong dinosaur enthusiast, I've been fascinated by prehistoric creatures from the Cambrian explosion and through the Paleozoic and Mesozoic eras. My personal favorite is the Plesiosaurus, with their Loch Ness monster-like bodies and paddle-like flippers. I find their unique adaptations for swimming, which is reminiscent of modern-day penguins and turtles, amazing.

My goal with this project is to create a simple and user-friendly resource for dinosaur lovers of all ages. While it may not be an encyclopedia-level database, I hope it provides enough information to spark interest and offer some fun facts.

As my skills grow, I plan to keep updating the Dino Database with more and more cool features. I'm excited to see where this project takes me!

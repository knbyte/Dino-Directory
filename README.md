# About the Dino-Directory ðŸ¦•

The Dino Database is a passion project I started to hone my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I'm a bit of a dinosaur enthusiast, fascinated by prehistoric creatures from the cambrian explosion and through the paleozoic and mezionic eras. My personal favorite is the Plesiosaurus, with their Loch Ness monster-like bodies, paddle-like flippers and their unique adaptations for swimming, which is reminiscent of modern-day penguins and turtles!

My goal with this project is to create a simple and user-friendly resource for dinosaur lovers of all ages. While it may not be an encyclopedia-level database, I hope it provides enough information to spark interest and offer some fun facts.

As my skills grow, I plan to keep updating the Dino Database with more and more cool features. I'm excited to see where this project takes me!
